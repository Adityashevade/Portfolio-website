# Scout DB Frontend Walkthrough

## Overview
I have successfully implemented the initial frontend for Scout DB, focusing on the **Vulnerability Overrides** feature and a dark-themed UI.

## Changes
### 1. Project Setup
- initialized a new React + TypeScript project with Vite in `c:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend`.
- Installed key dependencies: `tailwindcss`, `react-router-dom`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `axios`, `lucide-react`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`.
- Configured Tailwind CSS with a custom dark theme palette (Zinc/Slate) for a premium look.

### 2. Backend Configuration
- Updated `src/scout_db/main.py` to enable CORS, allowing the frontend (port 5173) to communicate with the backend (port 8666).

### 3. Frontend Architecture
- **Layout**: Implemented a responsive sidebar layout with navigation links to Overrides, Audit (todo), and Aliases (todo).
- **Routing**: Configured `react-router-dom` for navigation between list and form views.
- **API Client**: Created a configured Axios instance pointing to `http://localhost:8666/api/v1`.

### 4. Features Implemented
- **Overrides List**: Displays existing overrides in a sortable table with status badges.
- **Create Override Form**: A dynamic form to create new vulnerability overrides, supporting multiple field modifications.

## Verification results
### Automated Tests
- `npm run dev` starts the application successfully on `http://localhost:5173`.
- TypeScript configuration issues were resolved to ensure clean build/dev processes.

### Manual Verification Steps
1. Ensure the backend is running on port 8666.
2. Run `npm run dev` in `c:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend`.
3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
4. Navigate to "Overrides" to view the list.
5. Click "Create Override" to add a new entry.
