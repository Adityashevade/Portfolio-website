# Walkthrough: Git Scans UX & Performance Polish

I have completed the requested enhancements to the Git Scans page, focusing on a premium "Unique Experience" and improved performance.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. 3D Tilt & Spotlight Cards
- **Interactive Hover**: Project cards now respond to mouse movement, tilting in 3D space ("magnetic" effect).
- **Spotlight Gradient**: A subtle radial gradient follows your cursor over the card, highlighting the glassmorphism effect.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Entrance animations and hover states are staggered and eased for a premium feel.

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Memoized Components**: The project card rendering logic was extracted into a separate, memoized component (`ProjectCard`).
- **Reduced Re-renders**: This prevents the entire grid from re-rendering when you interact with unrelated elements (like the drawer or other cards), significantly improving responsiveness on large lists.

### 3. User Friendliness (Phase 2)
- **Provider Filters**: Added quick-filter pills (All, GitHub, GitLab, Azure) next to the search bar.
- **Skeleton Loading**: Replaced the generic spinner with shimmering card skeletons that match the grid layout, reducing layout shift.

### 4. Code Quality & Repair
- **Refactoring**: Cleaned up [GitProjectsList.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/components/GitProjectsList.tsx) by moving helper functions and sub-components to the module scope.
- **Robustness**: Re-implemented [normalizeRepository](file:///c:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/scan/page.tsx#898-944) to handle data inconsistencies across different Git providers (Azure vs GitHub vs GitLab) more reliably.

## Verification Steps
1.  **Hover over a Project Card**: Move your mouse across a card. Notice the 3D tilt and the spotlight following your cursor.
2.  **Filter Repositories**: Click the "GitHub" or "Azure" pills to instantly filter the list.
3.  **Refresh Data**: Click the refresh button and observe the new skeleton loading animation.
4.  **Check Performance**: Use the "Select All" or individual bulk selection checkboxes; the UI should remain snappy.
