# Walkthrough: Git Scans UX & Performance Polish

I have completed the requested enhancements to the Git Scans page, focusing on a premium "Unique Experience" and improved performance.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Visual Refresh & Color Pattern (New)
- **Unified Theme**: Replaced inconsistent pinks with a sophisticated **Violet-to-Fuchsia** gradient theme (`violet-500` -> `fuchsia-500`) for a modern, cohesive look.
- **Enhanced Hover Effects**: Borders and shadows now glow with the theme color on hover, adding depth without clutter.
- **Proper Formatting**: 
    -   Aligned the header icon, title, stats, and buttons perfectly.
    -    Standardized button sizes and spacing.
    -   Used consistent gradient backgrounds for primary actions (Add Project, Scan).
- **Interactive Heading**: The "Git Repository Scans" title now reveals a vibrant gradient on hover with a scaling icon.

### 2. "Wow" Features (Phase 5)
- **Animated Background Blobs**: Added subtle, floating gradient orbs behind the page to create depth and a dynamic feel.
- **Hero Stats Cards**: Upgraded the simple stats badges to prominent "Hero" cards with large typography and glassmorphism, making the data pop.

### 3. 3D Tilt & Spotlight (Expanded)
- **Universal 3D Effect**: The dynamic "magnetic" tilt and spotlight effect is now applied to **all** interactive elements:
    -   **Hero Stats**: The new stats cards also tilt!
    -   **Project Cards**: Main project grid items.
    -   **Action Buttons**: Refresh, Scan Selected, and Add Project buttons ([TiltContainer](file:///c:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/components/GitProjectsList.tsx#131-202)).
    -   **Filter Pills**: The provider toggles (GitHub/GitLab/Azure).

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Memoized Components**: The project card rendering logic was extracted into a separate, memoized component (`ProjectCard`).
- **Reduced Re-renders**: This prevents the entire grid from re-rendering when you interact with unrelated elements (like the drawer or other cards), significantly improving responsiveness on large lists.

### 5. User Friendliness (Phase 2)
- **Provider Filters**: Added quick-filter pills (All, GitHub, GitLab, Azure) next to the search bar.
- **Skeleton Loading**: Replaced the generic spinner with shimmering card skeletons that match the grid layout, reducing layout shift.

## Verification Steps
1.  **Observe the Background**: Notice the soft, moving gradients behind the content.
2.  **Check the Stats**: Look at the top left/center for the new large "Hero" stats cards. Hover over them to see the tilt and glow.
3.  **Hover the Title**: Move your mouse over "Git Repository Scans" to see the gradient reveal.
4.  **Hover Everywhere**: Move your mouse over project cards, the refresh button, or the provider filters. All boxes should now subtly tilt towards your cursor with a spotlight effect and a matching violet glow.
5.  **Search Bar**: Click the search bar to see the matching violet focus ring.
