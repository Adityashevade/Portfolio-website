# Walkthrough: Git Scans UX & Performance Polish

I have completed the requested enhancements to the Git Scans page, focusing on a premium "Unique Experience" and improved performance.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. 3D Tilt & Spotlight (Expanded)
- **Universal 3D Effect**: The dynamic "magnetic" tilt and spotlight effect is now applied to **all** interactive elements:
    -   **Project Cards**: Main project grid items.
    -   **Stats Cards**: The glossy boxes showing project/repo counts.
    -   **Action Buttons**: Refresh, Scan Selected, and Add Project buttons ([TiltContainer](file:///c:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/components/GitProjectsList.tsx#131-202)).
    -   **Filter Pills**: The provider toggles (GitHub/GitLab/Azure).
- **Smooth Interaction**: Each element has a simplified version of the tilt physics for a cohesive, premium feel without visual clutter.

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Memoized Components**: The project card rendering logic was extracted into a separate, memoized component (`ProjectCard`).
- **Reduced Re-renders**: This prevents the entire grid from re-rendering when you interact with unrelated elements (like the drawer or other cards), significantly improving responsiveness on large lists.

### 3. User Friendliness (Phase 2)
- **Provider Filters**: Added quick-filter pills (All, GitHub, GitLab, Azure) next to the search bar.
- **Skeleton Loading**: Replaced the generic spinner with shimmering card skeletons that match the grid layout, reducing layout shift.

### 4. Code Quality & Repair
- **Refactoring**: Cleaned up [GitProjectsList.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/components/GitProjectsList.tsx) by moving helper functions and sub-components to the module scope.
- **Robustness**: Re-implemented [normalizeRepository](file:///c:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/git-scans/git-scans-page-client.tsx#38-86) to handle data inconsistencies across different Git providers (Azure vs GitHub vs GitLab) more reliably.

## Verification Steps
1.  **Hover Everywhere**: Move your mouse over project cards, the refresh button, or the provider filters. All boxes should now subtly tilt towards your cursor with a spotlight effect.
2.  **Filter Repositories**: Click the "GitHub" or "Azure" pills to instantly filter the list.
3.  **Refresh Data**: Click the refresh button and observe the new skeleton loading animation.
4.  **Check Performance**: Use the "Select All" or individual bulk selection checkboxes; the UI should remain snappy.
