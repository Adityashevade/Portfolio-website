# Walkthrough: Git Scans UX & Performance Polish

I have completed the requested enhancements to the Git Scans page, focusing on a premium "Unique Experience" and improved performance.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Visual Refresh & Color Pattern (New)
- **Unified Theme**: Replaced inconsistent pinks with a sophisticated **Violet-to-Fuchsia** gradient theme (`violet-500` -> `fuchsia-500`) for a modern, cohesive look.
- **Enhanced Hover Effects**: Borders and shadows now glow with the theme color on hover, adding depth without clutter.
- **Proper Formatting**: 
    -   Aligned the header icon, title, stats, and buttons perfectly.
    -    Standardized button sizes and spacing.
    -   Used consistent gradient backgrounds for primary actions (Add Project, Scan).
- **Interactive Heading**: The "Git Repository Scans" title now reveals a vibrant gradient on hover.

### 2. 3D Tilt & Spotlight (Expanded)
- **Universal 3D Effect**: The dynamic "magnetic" tilt and spotlight effect is now applied to **all** interactive elements:
    -   **Project Cards**: Main project grid items.
    -   **Stats Cards**: The glossy boxes showing project/repo counts.
    -   **Action Buttons**: Refresh, Scan Selected, and Add Project buttons ([TiltContainer](file:///c:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/components/GitProjectsList.tsx#131-202)).
    -   **Filter Pills**: The provider toggles (GitHub/GitLab/Azure).
- **Smooth Interaction**: Each element has a simplified version of the tilt physics for a cohesive, premium feel without visual clutter.

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Memoized Components**: The project card rendering logic was extracted into a separate, memoized component (`ProjectCard`).
- **Reduced Re-renders**: This prevents the entire grid from re-rendering when you interact with unrelated elements (like the drawer or other cards), significantly improving responsiveness on large lists.

### 4. User Friendliness (Phase 2)
- **Provider Filters**: Added quick-filter pills (All, GitHub, GitLab, Azure) next to the search bar.
- **Skeleton Loading**: Replaced the generic spinner with shimmering card skeletons that match the grid layout, reducing layout shift.

## Verification Steps
1.  **Hover the Title**: Move your mouse over "Git Repository Scans" to see the gradient reveal.
2.  **Check the Header**: Notice the new Violet/Fuchsia gradient icon and how the "Add Project" button matches it.
3.  **Hover Everywhere**: Move your mouse over project cards, the refresh button, or the provider filters. All boxes should now subtly tilt towards your cursor with a spotlight effect and a matching violet glow.
4.  **Filter Repositories**: Click the "GitHub" or "Azure" pills to instantly filter the list.
5.  **Refresh Data**: Click the refresh button and observe the new skeleton loading animation.
