# Portfolio Website Implementation Plan

Building a professional portfolio for Aditya Shevade with a black and grey theme, highlighting skills in AI, Machine Learning, and Python Development.

## Proposed Changes

### [Frontend Components]

#### [MODIFY] [App.tsx](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/portfolio-website/src/App.tsx)
- Implement a modern, dark-themed layout.
- Sections:
    - **Navbar**: Sticky navigation with links to Hero, About, Skills, Experience, Projects, and Education.
    - **Hero**: Professional intro with name, title, and social links (GitHub, LinkedIn).
    - **About**: Brief summary of technical acumen.
    - **Skills**: Categorized grid (e.g., Languages, AI/ML, Tools).
    - **Experience**: Timeline or card-based view for the Python Developer Intern role.
    - **Projects**: Cards for "Reader Segmentation" and "Customer Churn Prediction" with links.
    - **Education & Training**: Cards for the BE and certifications.
    - **Contact**: Email and phone links.

#### [MODIFY] [index.css](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/portfolio-website/src/index.css)
- Refine dark mode variables for a "premium" black/grey aesthetic.
- Add smooth scrolling and hover animations.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run build` to ensure no TypeScript or build errors.
- Use `npm run dev` and verify visually (since browser tool is unavailable, I will rely on code correctness and user confirmation).

### Manual Verification
- Verify that all navigation links work correctly (smooth scroll).
- Check responsiveness on different screen widths in the design.
- Verify that GitHub/LinkedIn links are correct.
