# Portfolio Website Implementation Plan

Building a professional portfolio for Aditya Shevade with a black and grey theme, highlighting skills in AI, Machine Learning, and Python Development.

## Proposed Changes

### [Frontend Components]

#### [MODIFY] [index.css](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/portfolio-website/src/index.css)
- Change primary accent color to **Netflix Red (#E50914)**.
- Ensure deep black backgrounds and clean, high-contrast text.

#### [MODIFY] [App.tsx](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/portfolio-website/src/App.tsx)
- **Remove all images**: Delete the portrait and project screenshots.
- **Remove Testimonials**: Delete the star review section.
- **Hero**: Clean, bold typography with a "Netflix-esque" gradient or simple black background.
- **Projects**: Redesign as sleek cards (posters) with red hover effects.
- **Experience/Education**: Restore original text content in the new red/black style.

## Verification Plan
... (rest of the plan remains similar)

### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run build` to ensure no TypeScript or build errors.
- Use `npm run dev` and verify visually (since browser tool is unavailable, I will rely on code correctness and user confirmation).

### Manual Verification
- Verify that all navigation links work correctly (smooth scroll).
- Check responsiveness on different screen widths in the design.
- Verify that GitHub/LinkedIn links are correct.
