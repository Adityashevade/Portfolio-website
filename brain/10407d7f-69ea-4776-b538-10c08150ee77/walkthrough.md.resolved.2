# Portfolio Website Completed

I have successfully built your professional portfolio website using React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

## Key Features
- **Netflix Aesthetic**: A sleek, high-contrast black and red theme (#E50914).
- **Minimalist Layout**: Completely image-free and focused on typography and data.
- **Bold Hero Section**: Massive, upper-case header for your name with a subtle red back-glow.
- **Sleek Project Cards**: "Poster-style" project cards with card-specific red hover effects.
- **Resume Preservation**: All your original experience, skills, and education details are restored.
- **Social Integration**: High-contrast icons for GitHub and LinkedIn in the header.

## How to View Your Website
1. **Open the Terminal** in your project directory: `C:\Users\Aditya\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\portfolio-website`.
2. **Run the command**:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open the link**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Deployment (Optional)
If you want to deploy this website, I recommend using **Vercel** or **Netlify**. I have already verified that the project builds successfully (`npm run build`).

Enjoy your new professional showcase!
