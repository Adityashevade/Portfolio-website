# Portfolio Website Implementation Plan

Building a professional portfolio for Aditya Shevade with a black and grey theme, highlighting skills in AI, Machine Learning, and Python Development.

## Proposed Changes

### [Frontend Components]

#### [MODIFY] [index.css](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/portfolio-website/src/index.css)
- Change primary accent color to a vibrant **Yellow (#facc15)**.
- Implement bold, large typography styles for headings.
- Add "glassmorphism" or subtle gradients where appropriate to match the premium feel.

#### [MODIFY] [App.tsx](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/portfolio-website/src/App.tsx)
- **Hero**: Large centered name, hashtags for roles, portrait image layout, and yellow "Contact Me" button.
- **Skills**: Redesign as "Capabilities" with large text and arrow icons.
- **Projects**: Redesign as "Featured Work" with larger project cards.
- **Testimonials**: Add a section for feedback snippets.

## Verification Plan
... (rest of the plan remains similar)

### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run build` to ensure no TypeScript or build errors.
- Use `npm run dev` and verify visually (since browser tool is unavailable, I will rely on code correctness and user confirmation).

### Manual Verification
- Verify that all navigation links work correctly (smooth scroll).
- Check responsiveness on different screen widths in the design.
- Verify that GitHub/LinkedIn links are correct.
