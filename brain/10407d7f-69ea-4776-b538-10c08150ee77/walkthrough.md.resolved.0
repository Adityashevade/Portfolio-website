I have successfully built your professional portfolio website using React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Works perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Resume Integration**: All sections (Summary, Experience, Projects, Skills, Education) are populated with your details.
- **GitHub Connectivity**: Projects are linked directly to your GitHub repositories.
- **Interactive UI**: Hover effects, smooth scrolling, and shadcn/ui components.

## How to View Your Website
1. **Open the Terminal** in your project directory: `C:\Users\Aditya\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\portfolio-website`.
2. **Run the command**:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open the link**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Deployment (Optional)
If you want to deploy this website, I recommend using **Vercel** or **Netlify**. I have already verified that the project builds successfully (`npm run build`).
