# Portfolio Website Completed

I have successfully built your professional portfolio website using React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

## Key Features
- **Netflix Aesthetic**: A sleek, high-contrast black and red theme (#E50914).
- **Multi-Page Routing**: Dedicated pages for Home and Contact using `react-router-dom`.
- **Smooth Sliding Transitions**: Premium page-to-page transitions implemented with `framer-motion`.
- **Minimalist Contact Page**: A dedicated space for your phone, email, and social links with a clean "Netflix-poster" style.
- **Bold Hero & Navigation**: Custom Netflix-style "A" logo and a transparent-to-black gradient header.
- **Resume Integration**: Full professional history preserved across the new architecture.

## How to Get Your Shareable Link
Once you have pushed your code to GitHub and connected it to Vercel:

1. **Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)**.
2. Click on your **Portfolio Project**.
3. Under the **"Deployment"** section, you will see a preview image of your site.
4. The link ending in **`.vercel.app`** (e.g., `portfolio-website-abc.vercel.app`) is your shareable link!
5. **Custom Link**: You can change this to something like `aditya-shevade.vercel.app` in **Settings > Domains**.

## How to View Your Website
1. **Open the Terminal** in your project directory: `C:\Users\Aditya\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\portfolio-website`.
2. **Run the command**:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open the link**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Deployment (Optional)
If you want to deploy this website, I recommend using **Vercel** or **Netlify**. I have already verified that the project builds successfully (`npm run build`).

Enjoy your new professional showcase!
