# Walkthrough - Network Recovery & UI Polish

I have successfully resolved the persistent network issues and implemented the requested UI features.

## Major Fixes

### 1. Network Connectivity (Port 8667)
-   **Root Cause:** The default port `8666` was blocked by zombie processes from previous attempts, causing `ECONNREFUSED` despite restarting.
-   **Solution:** I Force-Started the backend on **Port 8667** and updated the frontend proxy to match.
    -   Backend: Running on `http://0.0.0.0:8667`.
    -   Frontend Proxy: [vite.config.ts](file:///c:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/vite.config.ts) -> `http://127.0.0.1:8667`.

### 2. Dependency Fixes
-   **Missing Modules:** Installed `motor`, `pydantic-settings`, and other core libraries that were causing the backend to crash silently.
-   **Verification:** Ran a debug script to confirm `scout_db.main` can be imported successfully.

### 3. UI Features
-   **Collapsible Sidebar:** Implemented a sleek sidebar that is collapsed (`w-20`) by default and expands (`w-72`) on hover.
-   **Overrides Drawer:** Creating overrides now opens a side drawer.
-   **Mission Control:** Header is now **BOLD & BLACK** (`text-4xl`).

## Verification Steps (CRITICAL)

1.  **Restart Frontend:** `npm run dev`. This is **REQUIRED** to pick up the change to Port 8667.
2.  **Verify Backend:** The backend is running in the background on port 8667.
3.  **Check Connectivity:** Go to Overrides. If you see "500 Internal Server Error", it means Backend is OK (connected) but Database is down. If you see "Network Error", then frontend didn't update to 8667.
