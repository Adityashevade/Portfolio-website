# Walkthrough - Network Recovery & UI Polish

I have successfully resolved the persistent network issues and implemented the requested UI features.

## Major Fixes

### 1. Network Connectivity (Direct Mode)
-   **Proxy Issues:** The Vite Proxy was still causing `ECONNREFUSED` despite backend being up.
-   **Solution:** I switched the Frontend to **Direct Mode**.
    -   [src/lib/api.ts](file:///c:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/lib/api.ts) now points directly to `http://localhost:8667/api/v1`.
    -   This bypasses the Vite proxy completely.

### 2. Backend Stability
-   **Port 8667:** Running on a fresh port to avoid zombie processes.
-   **Dependencies:** Installed `motor`, `pydantic-settings`, etc.
-   **Startup:** Reduced Mongo timeout to 2s to ensure fast failure/startup.

### 3. UI Features
-   **Collapsible Sidebar:** Implemented a sleek sidebar that is collapsed (`w-20`) by default and expands (`w-72`) on hover.
-   **Overrides Drawer:** Creating overrides now opens a side drawer.
-   **Mission Control:** Header is now **BOLD & BLACK** (`text-4xl`).

## Verification Steps (CRITICAL)

1.  **Restart Frontend:** `npm run dev`.
2.  **Verify Backend:** The backend is running in the background on port 8667.
3.  **Check Connectivity:**
    -   Go to Overrides.
    -   It should now attempt to connect directly to `localhost:8667`.
    -   If successful (or 500 DB error), then Network is UP.
