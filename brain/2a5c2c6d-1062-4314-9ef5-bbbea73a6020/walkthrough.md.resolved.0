# Walkthrough: Right-Side Drawers for Mission Control

## Changes Summary
Replaced the modal dialogs for "Add New Project" and "Upload SBOM" with modern right-side drawers (Sheets) to improve the user experience and visual consistency.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Verification of "Add New Project" Drawer
1.  Navigate to the **Mission Control** / **Scan** page.
2.  Click the **Add New Project** card/button.
3.  **Expectation**: A drawer should slide in from the right side of the screen.
4.  Enter a Project Name and click **Next**.
5.  **Expectation**: The drawer connects to the next step (Select Git Provider).
6.  Select a Git Provider (e.g., GitHub).
7.  **Expectation**: The "Connect to Git Provider" view effectively replaces the current view or opens a new drawer (depending on exact flow, but should feel seamless).

### 2. Verification of "Upload SBOM File" Drawer
1.  Click the **Upload SBOM File** card/button.
2.  **Expectation**: A drawer should slide in from the right side.
3.  Fill in the form (Project Group, Target Name, etc.).
4.  Upload a dummy [.json](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/package.json) file.
5.  Click **Upload**.
6.  **Expectation**: The upload should proceed (or mock succeed) and the drawer should close or show success.

### 3. Visual Checks
-   Ensure the drawers have appropriate width (`max-w-[600px]` or `500px`).
-   Verify the close button (X) works.
-   Verify the backdrop (overlay) dims the background.
