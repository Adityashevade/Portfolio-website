# Implement Right-Side Drawer for Project Details

## Goal Description
The goal is to change the behavior of the Project List in the Mission Control section. Currently, clicking a project expands it inline (accordion style) to show its repositories. The user wants this interaction to open a right-side drawer instead, consistent with the "Add New Project" and "Upload SBOM" experiences.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> This change replaces the inline expansion (accordion) behavior for projects with a drawer.

## Proposed Changes

### Client
#### [MODIFY] [GitProjectsList.tsx](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/components/GitProjectsList.tsx)
-   Import [Sheet](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/components/ui/sheet.tsx#91-103), [SheetContent](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/components/ui/sheet.tsx#52-55), [SheetHeader](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/components/ui/sheet.tsx#77-89), `SheetTitle`, `SheetDescription` from `@/components/ui/sheet`.
-   Add state `drawerProject` (string | null) to track the project currently open in the drawer.
-   Modify the project header `onClick` handler to set `drawerProject` instead of toggling `expandedProjects`.
-   Remove or comment out the inline expansion rendering block (`{isExpanded && ...}`).
-   Add a [Sheet](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/components/ui/sheet.tsx#91-103) component at the end of the return statement (or nearby other dialogs).
    -   `open={!!drawerProject}`
    -   `onOpenChange={(open) => !open && setDrawerProject(null)}`
    -   `side="right"`
    -   Content:
        -   Header: Project Name and Metadata.
        -   Body: The list of repositories for that project (migrated from the inline expansion section).
        -   Include the "Bulk Scan" or selection logic if relevant inside the drawer, or keep global selection working.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Project List Interaction:**
    -   Go to the "Mission Control" / "Scan" page.
    -   Scroll to the Project List.
    -   Click on a project row (e.g., "Test Projects").
    -   **Expectation**: A right-side drawer opens.
    -   **Expectation**: The drawer contains the list of repositories for that project.
2.  **Drawer Functionality:**
    -   Verify you can select repositories inside the drawer.
    -   Verify branch selection works inside the drawer.
    -   Verify closing the drawer works.
