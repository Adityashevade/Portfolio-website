# Styles Hover Buttons on SBOM Cards

The user wants to improve the hover interaction on "Uploaded SBOM" cards in Mission Control (specifically referencing "client1.0", "client2.0", "image_lab"). The buttons for "Analyze" and "DETAILS" (currently "View") should be styled as proper buttons and not be clipped.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> I am assuming "DETAILS" refers to the "View" button found in [uploaded-sbom-scan-page-client.tsx](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/uploaded-sbom-scan/uploaded-sbom-scan-page-client.tsx). I will rename "View" to "DETAILS".

## Proposed Changes

### Client
#### [MODIFY] [uploaded-sbom-scan-page-client.tsx](file:///C:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/uploaded-sbom-scan/uploaded-sbom-scan-page-client.tsx)
- locate the card rendering loop (grid view).
- Modify the hover action bar section.
- Rename "View" button text to "DETAILS".
- Update button variants from `outline` to `default` or customized filled style on hover (e.g., `bg-indigo-600 text-white` for Details, `bg-amber-500` for Analyze).
- Adjust the `absolute bottom-0` positioning/padding or remove `overflow-hidden` (if safe) or adjust margins to prevent clipping.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- None.

### Manual Verification
- Navigate to the "Uploaded SBOM" page/section.
- Hover over the cards ("client1.0", etc.).
- Verify "DETAILS" and "Analyze" buttons appear.
- Verify they look like buttons (filled/prominent).
- Verify they are not clipped.
