# Navigation & State Preservation Fix

I have investigated and fixed the issue where filter state was being lost when navigating back from detail pages to the list view.

## The Issue
When a user applied filters on the Vulnerabilities list page and then navigated to a detail page, clicking "Back" would effectively reload the list page from scratch (clearing the URL parameters), causing all filters to be lost.

Similarly, in "Mission Control", navigating to an SBOM detail page and clicking "Back" would redirect to a different page (`/sbom`) instead of returning to Mission Control, causing confusion and potential errors.

## The Fix

### Vulnerability & Dependency Details
I updated the "Back" button logic in the [vulnerability-detail-client.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/_detail-pages/vulnerability/vulnerability-detail-client.tsx) component.
- **Before**: `navigate("/module/scout/vulnerabilities")` - Hard reset.
- **After**: `window.history.back()` - Preserves history and state.

Verified that [dependency-detail-client.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/_detail-pages/dependency/dependency-detail-client.tsx) already uses `window.history.back()`.

### SBOM Details
I updated the "Back" button logic in [sbom-detail-client.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/_detail-pages/sbom/sbom-detail-client.tsx).
- **Before**: `<Link href="/module/scout/sbom">Back to SBOMs</Link>` - Incorrect redirection.
- **After**: `onClick={() => window.history.back()}` - Correctly returns to previous context (e.g., Mission Control).

## Benefits
- **Persistent Filters**: Users can now drill down into details and return to their filtered list without losing context.
- **Improved UX**: Preserves the scrolling position and loaded data state.
- **Correct Navigation**: Users stay within their current workflow (Mission Control vs SBOM List).

## Verification
1.  **Vulnerabilities**: Apply filters, view details, click Back. Verify filters persist.
2.  **Mission Control**: Click "View" on an SBOM. Click Back. Verify return to Mission Control without errors.
