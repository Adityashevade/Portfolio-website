# Implementation Plan - Root NPM Configuration

The goal is to allow the user to run `npm run dev` (and other scripts) directly from the root directory `C:\SCOUTNEW` without needing to navigate into subdirectories.

## User Review Required

> [!NOTE]
> This will create a new `package.json` in the root directory. It will forward commands to `scout_db/frontend`.

## Proposed Changes

### Root Directory

#### [NEW] [package.json](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/package.json)
- Create a `package.json` file in `C:\SCOUTNEW`.
- Define scripts (`dev`, `build`, `lint`, etc.) that use `--prefix scout_db/frontend` to forward commands to the frontend application.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run dev` from `C:\SCOUTNEW` and verify it starts the Vite server on port 5173.
- Run `npm run build` from `C:\SCOUTNEW` and verify it builds the frontend.
