# Implementation Plan - Light Mode Refinement

The goal is to perfect the light mode design by ensuring high contrast, proper colors, and removing all "grey/dark" artifacts that make the UI look muddy.

## User Review Required

> [!NOTE]
> The light mode background will be changed to a very subtle off-white (`#f8f9fa` or similar) to allow the pure white cards to stand out, matching the reference image style.

## Proposed Changes

### Configuration

#### [MODIFY] [index.css](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/index.css)
- **Light Theme Background**: Change `--background` to `210 40% 98%` (Alice Blue/Off-white) or `0 0% 98%` (Zinc 50).
- **Cards**: Ensure `--card` is `0 0% 100%` (Pure White).
- **Shadows**: Tune shadows to be soft and diffuse.

### Components

#### [MODIFY] [Dashboard.tsx](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx)
- **Remove Hardcoded Colors**: Replace all instances of `text-white`, `bg-white/x` with semantic classes:
    - `text-white` -> `text-foreground`
    - `bg-white/5` -> `bg-accent` or `bg-muted`
- **Colored Text**: Update specific colors to be readable in light mode:
    - `text-purple-400` -> `text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-400`
    - `text-pink-400` -> `text-pink-600 dark:text-pink-400`
    - `text-emerald-400` -> `text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400`
- **Charts/Bars**: Update chart bar backgrounds to be visible in light mode.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Check Dashboard in Light Mode:
    - Cards should be white on a light grey background.
    - Text should be dark and legible.
    - Icons should have colored backgrounds.
- Check Dashboard in Dark Mode:
    - Should remain unchanged (dark deep space look).
