# Light Mode Implementation & Refinement

We have successfully implemented a clean, premium Light Mode for the application and refined the UI to match the reference design.

## Key Changes

### 1. Global Light Theme ([index.css](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/index.css))
- **Background**: Changed to a subtle off-white (`#f8f9fa`) to provide contrast for white cards.
- **Cards**: Enforced pure white (`#ffffff`) for all cards using the `.kaleido-card` class.
- **Text & Colors**: Updated theme variables to ensuring high contrast and vibrant colors (Emerald, Purple, Pink) in light mode.

### 2. Dashboard Component ([Dashboard.tsx](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx))
- **Semantic Styling**: Replaced hardcoded `text-white` and dark backgrounds with theme-aware utility classes.
- **System Health Card Fix**: 
    - Removed the dark gradient overlay that was persistent in light mode.
    - Standardized the card structure to use the global `.kaleido-card` class, guaranteeing a white background in light mode.
    - Verified that text and icons remain visible and vibrant.

### 3. Layout & Navigation ([Layout.tsx](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx))
- **Theme-Aware Sidebar**: The sidebar now adapts to light mode (white/grey) instead of being permanently dark.
- **Navbar**: Updated to be transparent/light in light mode.

### 4. Mode Toggle ([mode-toggle.tsx](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/components/mode-toggle.tsx))
- **Simplified Options**: Removed the "System" option, leaving only "Light" and "Dark" for explicit user control.

## Verification
- **Light Mode**: 
    - Dashboard background is off-white.
    - All 4 stats cards are pure white.
    - "System Health" card is white with green accents (no grey/dark gradient).
    - Text is dark and readable.
- **Dark Mode**: 
    - Preserved the original "deep space" aesthetic with dark blue backgrounds and gradients.
