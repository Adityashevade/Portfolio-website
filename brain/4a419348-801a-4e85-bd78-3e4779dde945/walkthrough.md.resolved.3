# Light Mode Implementation & Refinement

We have successfully implemented a clean, premium Light Mode for the application and refined the UI to match the reference design.

## Key Changes

### 1. Global Light Theme ([index.css](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/index.css))
- **Background**: Changed to a subtle off-white (`#f8f9fa`) to provide contrast for white cards.
- **Cards**: Enforced pure white (`#ffffff`) for all cards using the `.kaleido-card` class.
- **Text & Colors**: Updated theme variables to ensuring high contrast and vibrant colors (Emerald, Purple, Pink) in light mode.

### 2. Dashboard Component ([Dashboard.tsx](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx))
- **Semantic Styling**: Replaced hardcoded `text-white` and dark backgrounds with theme-aware utility classes.
- **System Health Card Fix**: 
    - Removed the dark gradient overlay that was persistent in light mode.
    - Standardized the card structure to use the global `.kaleido-card` class, guaranteeing a white background in light mode.
    - Verified that text and icons remain visible and vibrant.

### 3. Layout & Navigation ([Layout.tsx](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx))
- **Theme-Aware Sidebar**: The sidebar now adapts to light mode (white/grey) instead of being permanently dark.
- **Navbar**: Updated to be transparent/light in light mode.

### 4. Mode Toggle ([mode-toggle.tsx](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/components/mode-toggle.tsx))
- **Simplified Options**: Removed the "System" option, leaving only "Light" and "Dark" for explicit user control.

## Verification
- **Light Mode**: 
    - Dashboard background is off-white.
    - All 4 stats cards are pure white.
    - "System Health" card is white with green accents (no grey/dark gradient).
    - Text is dark and readable.
- **Dark Mode**: 
    - Preserved the original "deep space" aesthetic with dark blue backgrounds and gradients.

### 5. Backend Stability & Debugging
- **Resolved "Failed to Load" Error**:
    - **Port Mismatch Fixed**: Frontend proxy was pointing to port 8005, while backend runs on 8000. Corrected [vite.config.ts](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/vite.config.ts).
    - **Router Conflict Resolved**: The backend had overlapping routes where `/api/v1/search` was masked by a generic `/api/v1/vulnerabilities/{id}` route.
    - **Fix**: Changed vulnerability search route to `/api/v1/vulnerabilities/search` and prioritized it in [main.py](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/src/scout_db/main.py).
- **Verified API Endpoints**:
    - `/api/v1/audit`: Returns 200 OK (Audit Logs functional).
    - `/api/v1/vulnerabilities/status`: Returns 200 OK (Database loaded).
    - `/api/v1/vulnerabilities/search`: Returns 200 OK with JSON data.

### 6. Final UI Polish & Features
- **Ecosystem Sync**: Updated dropdowns to include all 12+ ecosystems found in your database (crates.io, packagist, etc.).
- **Dropdown Fixes**: Forced all dropdowns on the Aliases page to open downwards for better usability.
- **Alias Logic**: Enforced "Bidirectional" mode for all new aliases to ensure consistent resolution.
- **Custom Cursor Refinements**:
    - **Scope**: Limited the custom "dot" cursor to only appear over the Histogram charts.
    - **Theming**: Implemented a **Pink** theme for Light Mode and **White** for Dark Mode using CSS variables ([index.css](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/index.css)), ensuring perfect visibility.

### 7. Alias Package Suggestions
- **New Component**: Created [PackageTagInput.tsx](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/components/shared/PackageTagInput.tsx) to provide intelligent suggestions for package names during alias creation.
- **Integration**: Replaced the basic text input in [AliasForm](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/pages/Aliases/AliasForm.tsx#32-176) with this smart component.
- **Logic**: Fetches package names from the vulnerability database (`/api/v1/vulnerabilities/search`) as the user types.

### 8. Override Form Enhancements
- **Wider Drawers**: Increased the width of both "Create Alias" and "Create Override" drawers to **90%** of the screen (`w-[90%]`) for better usability.
- **Editable Vulnerability Form**:
    - **New Component**: Created [VulnerabilityEditForm.tsx](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/components/VulnerabilityEditForm.tsx) to replace the read-only details card.
    - **Features**: Users can now directly edit Summary, Details, Severity, References, and Affected Packages.
    - **Smart Logic**: The form automatically calculates differences between original and edited data and sends only the necessary override operations to the backend.
- **Simplified Workflow**: Removed the manual "Fields" section (Add Field button) from the Override Form, relying entirely on the intuitive edit form.
