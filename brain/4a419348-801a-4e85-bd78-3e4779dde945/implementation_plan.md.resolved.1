# Implementation Plan - UI Improvements

The goal is to refine the application's layout, specifically addressing the user's feedback that the navbar is "very large" and the sidebar needs improvement.

## User Review Required

> [!NOTE]
> The Navbar height will be significantly reduced from `96px` (h-24) to `64px` (h-16).

## Proposed Changes

### Frontend Components

#### [MODIFY] [Layout.tsx](file:///C:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx)
- **Navbar (`header`)**:
    - Reduce height to `h-16`.
    - Adjust padding and alignment of title and subtitles.
    - Make the "System Online" pill more subtle.
- **Sidebar (`aside`)**:
    - Refine the hover transition to be smoother.
    - optimize spacing (`gap`) to look less sparse if needed.
    - Enhance the visual polish (gradients, borders) for a more "premium" feel.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Run the app (`npm run dev`) and visually inspect:
    - Navbar height and content alignment.
    - Sidebar hover behavior and aesthetics.
    - Responsiveness on smaller screens (though the current layout is desktop-focused).
