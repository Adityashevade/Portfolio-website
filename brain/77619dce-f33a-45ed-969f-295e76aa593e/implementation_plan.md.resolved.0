# Implementation Plan - Fix Projects Click Error

## Problem
User reports an error when clicking on "projects" in the Mission Control page.

## Investigation
1.  **Analyze Code**: details of `handleProjectClick` or similar in `GitProjectsList.tsx` and how it's passed/used in [scan/page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Aditya/SCOUT_Frontend/client/src/pages/scoutCustomPages/scan/page.tsx).
2.  **Hypothesis**:
    *   Missing prop propagation.
    *   Undefined callback.
    *   Data shape mismatch.

## Proposed Changes
*   TBD based on investigation.

## Verification
*   Review code logic.
