# Walkthrough - Scout DB UI Refinements

This walkthrough documents the UI/UX improvements made to the Vulnerability Overrides section of Scout DB.

## Diff Viewer Data Restoration

I have fixed an issue where the "Original / Previous" view in the difference popup was unexpectedly empty.

- **Key Alignment**: Updated the frontend to use the `raw` key (matching the backend response) instead of [original](file:///c:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/src/scout_db/services/override_service.py#281-314). You can now see the comparison between the database default and your override correctly.

## Action Column Simplification

I have simplified the actions available in the Vulnerability Overrides list for a cleaner, more focused interface.

- **Removed "Revert Override"**: Deleted the red "revert" button and its associated logic from the table. The actions column now focuses on viewing details and differences.

## Search & Navigation Refinements

I have improved the behavior of the form when searching for new vulnerabilities to ensure all relevant data is immediately visible.

- **Forced Expansion**: The "Affected Packages" and "References" sections now **always start expanded** when a new vulnerability is selected.
- **Pagination Reset**: Pagination for Affected Packages now **resets to page 1** on every new search.

## UI Layout Optimization (Create Override Form)

I have significantly improved the layout and usability of the form to minimize scrolling and enhance clarity.

### Key Changes:
- **Two-Column Layout**: Restructured the main content into two columns:
    - **Left Column**: Compact **CVSS Score** and matched, compact **Severity Level** inputs (both `w-24`).
    - **Right Column**: **Affected Packages** list.
- **Collapsible Sections**: Added toggle arrows to collapse/expand sections for manual space management.
- **Refined Styling**: Reduced padding and font sizes for a professional, high-density look.

### Proof of Work:

> [!NOTE]
> Due to a persistent environment issue with Playwright ($HOME variable not set), fresh screenshots of the final refined layout could not be captured. The implementation has been verified through internal code review and linting.

### Files Modified:
- [OverrideList.tsx](file:///c:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/pages/Overrides/OverrideList.tsx): Fixed diff data key mismatch and removed the "Revert Override" button.
- [OverrideForm.tsx](file:///c:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/pages/Overrides/OverrideForm.tsx): Removed redundant headers and implemented the React key reset for fresh state.
- [VulnerabilityEditForm.tsx](file:///c:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/components/VulnerabilityEditForm.tsx): Implemented two-column layout, collapsible sections, pagination, and compact severity styling.
