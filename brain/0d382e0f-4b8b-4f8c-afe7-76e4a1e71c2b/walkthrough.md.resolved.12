# Walkthrough - Scout DB UI Refinements

This walkthrough documents the UI/UX improvements made to the Vulnerability Overrides section of Scout DB.

## Redundant Element Removal & Header Streamlining

I have streamlined the "Create Override" interface by removing redundant headers and cards, significantly reducing the vertical footprint.

- **Removed `SheetHeader`**: Eliminated the redundant "Create New Override" title and description from the drawer component.
- **Removed [OverrideForm](file:///c:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/pages/Overrides/OverrideForm.tsx#9-167) Header**: Removed the second "Create Override" title/description within the form itself.
- **Removed Summary Card**: Integrated the vulnerability ID directly into the edit form header for a cleaner look.

## Search & Navigation Refinements

I have improved the behavior of the form when searching for new vulnerabilities to ensure all relevant data is immediately visible.

- **Default Expansion**: The "Affected Packages" and "References" sections now start **uncollapsed (expanded)** by default when a new vulnerability is searched.
- **Pagination Reset**: Pagination for Affected Packages now **resets to page 1** on every new search, ensuring the user sees the first set of items immediately.
- **Persistent Pagination**: The pagination feature itself remains functional, allowing users to navigate through all affected packages (2 per page).

## UI Layout Optimization (Create Override Form)

I have significantly improved the layout and usability of the form to minimize scrolling and enhance clarity.

### Key Changes:
- **Two-Column Layout**: Restructured the main content into two columns:
    - **Left Column**: Compact **CVSS Score** and centered, mono-font **Severity Level** inputs.
    - **Right Column**: **Affected Packages** list.
- **Collapsible Sections**: Added toggle arrows to collapse/expand "Affected Packages" and "References" for manual space management.
- **Refined Styling**: Reduced padding and font sizes for a professional, high-density look.

### Proof of Work:

> [!NOTE]
> Due to a persistent environment issue with Playwright ($HOME variable not set), fresh screenshots of the final refined layout could not be captured. The implementation has been verified through internal code review and linting.

### Files Modified:
- [OverrideList.tsx](file:///c:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/pages/Overrides/OverrideList.tsx): Removed redundant `SheetHeader`.
- [OverrideForm.tsx](file:///c:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/pages/Overrides/OverrideForm.tsx): Removed redundant headers and increased container width.
- [VulnerabilityEditForm.tsx](file:///c:/SCOUTNEW/scout_db/frontend/src/components/VulnerabilityEditForm.tsx): Implemented two-column layout, collapsible sections, pagination reset, and compact severity styling.
